# Differential Geometry library

Differential geometry is a fascinating subject.

Currently, trying to build a differential geometry library, based on Sage Manifolds, powerful enough to do some general relativity computations.

# API
Assuming everything is correct, this library is powerful enough to say something about the `Schwarzschild` spacetime. 

Still need to simplify stuff and make it easier to use.
